**General Idea**  - A general description of what your software will do  
Due to the influence of COVID-19, medical resources are less reachable, and people are concerned about how to allocate medical resources fairly and effectively. Instead of visiting different hospital websites to find out the earliest possible appointments and getting useful information from scarce resources, building up a medical platform to unite the hospitals in one region and realize resources sharing and arrangement among different hospitals could be a better solution. In this hackathon, we want to implement a mini-public medical platform that can break the boundaries between hospitals, realize cross-hospital appointments, online consultation, information sharing, and other one-stop services to get to the patients at the earliest time.

In this online doctor reservation web system, users will be able to access the general information of hospitals in Philadelphia, including its location, specialty, and doctor. Besides that, users can reserve a time slot to meet the doctor with a particular specialty on a specific day, and the system will provide all available doctors at that time. After the time is chosen, an agenda will be added to the users' calendar in this web app. Users will also be able to provide feedback to a specific doctor after the meeting.

**Anticipated Stack** - What technologies do you anticipate using?  
Frontend: ReactJS with Bootstrap and CSS for styling
Backend: Spring Boot, Spring Security, JWT, SQL
Database: MySQL holding on AWS
